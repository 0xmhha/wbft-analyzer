# wbft-analyzer

wbft-analyzer loads what WBFT networks record and shows how consensus ran.
Its inputs come from the other WBFT repositories:

- block headers (participation, proposers, epochs) over RPC;
- node logs, the consensus event streams and the message journals of
  [wbft](https://github.com/0xmhha/wbft) nodes;
- the JSON reports of [wbft-inspector](https://github.com/0xmhha/wbft-inspector),
  the only source of verdicts: the analyzer does not decide requirements
  itself, it places the inspector's verdicts and observations on the
  timelines it derives.

The data goes into PostgreSQL; derived tables (participation matrix, round
timelines, message latency, observation trends) are served over a REST API
to a static web front end.

## Status

The analyzer is built in stages; this repository is at the start of the
first one (A0):

| Stage | Content | State |
|---|---|---|
| A0 | command skeleton, inspector report loader with the public-build checks, PostgreSQL store, observation trends and alerts, API and front-end skeleton | started |
| A1 | header analysis: participation, proposers, epochs | not started |
| A2 | node logs and chainbench runs | not started |
| A3 | wbft event streams and mixed networks | not started |
| A4 | governance history | not started |

Every command is listed by `wbft-analyzer help`; a command that is not built
yet says so and exits with code 69.

## Build and test

```
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

Go 1.26.8 or later.

## Public scope

The analyzer only accepts reports of the public inspector build for the
requirements of the public specification; a report naming anything else is
refused as a whole. It shows improvement IDs as given and carries no
description of them.
